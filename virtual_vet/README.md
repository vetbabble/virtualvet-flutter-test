# Virtual Vet (VetBabble Assignment)

This project is part of an assignment for VetBabble

## Getting Started

Custom designs are always a challenge and take more time to complete. My approach was to keep it simple and modular.

I used stateless widget at most places. Only Today's Tasks widget was Stateful since I needed to show user response when a task was completed. 

Only one dependency was used (for SVG assets) since SVG are best choices for icons and we can dynamically change it's color.
